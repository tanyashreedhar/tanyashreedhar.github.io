I have been selected to attend the [Heidelberg Laureate Forum (HLF)](https://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/). HLF is a prestigious event where carefully selected young researchers in mathematics and computer science spend a week interacting with the laureates of the disciplines: recipients of the Abel Prize, ACM Turing Award, ACM Prize in Computing, Fields Medal and Nevanlinna Prize.
