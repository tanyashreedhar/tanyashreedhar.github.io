I am organizing and moderating a [panel](https://tanyashreedhar.github.io/documents/Flyers/PerFail-flyer-full.pdf) in [PerFail 2022](https://perfail-workshop.github.io/2022/) co-located with [IEEE PerCom 2022](https://www.percom.org/). The panel consisting of faculty members and industry researchers will share their experiences and learnings to normalize failures and negative results in research.
