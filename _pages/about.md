<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Informatics at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics). I am currently a part of the [NetSys group](https://netsys.inf.ed.ac.uk/) under the guidance of [Prof. Mahesh Marina](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mmarina/). I received my PhD from IIIT-Delhi, India in 2022 under the supervision of [Dr. Sanjit K. Kaul](https://sites.google.com/view/sanjitkkaul/). I was also a visiting researcher at the [Chair of Connected Mobility](https://www.in.tum.de/cm/home/) at the [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.cm.in.tum.de/en/research-group/joerg-ott/) in 2020 working with Prof. Dr.-Ing JÃ¶rg Ott. Before joining my PhD, I did my Bachelor in Engineering and received an academic gold medal from [Panjab University, Chandigarh](http://puchd.ac.in/), India.

My research interests lie broadly in the area of networks and systems. I work in the area of next-generation transport protocols, specifically but not limited to MultiPath TCP, QUIC and Age Control Protocol. My current research includes working on wireless and mobile systems with a focus on data-driven networking.  Additionally, I enjoy working on problems in edge/cloud computing, Internet measurements and emerging Internet applications.
